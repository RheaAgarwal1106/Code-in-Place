# Code-in-Place
1.	As a trainee, I enhance my programming skills in python through challenging situation based questions
2.	Worked on a python project 'Fish Weight Predictor', which predicts the weight of a fish with 83% of accuracy measured by variables like cross-section, length, width, height and species using data analysis, data visualization, multi-variate regression and machine learning.
